## About

Banking System is a web application that implements the basic functions of the banking system. It allows you to register a client, open and close accounts and deposits, apply for loans, and transfer funds between users. Each client has access to a personal profile for managing their products.

The project was created to demonstrate the principles of the banking back-end and can serve as a training base for understanding customer accounting processes, account transactions and financial products. The code is written in C# and can easily be extended with additional functionality.
